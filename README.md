 The Last Message 

A Visual Novel by Anirudh Sahu

---

A strange message.  

A haunting memory.  

A choice that will change everything.

It was just an ordinary evening at school, until a mysterious message appeared on your screen:  

I know your secret. Play my game or I'll tell everyone

Will you face the truth?  

Or will you run from it forever?
